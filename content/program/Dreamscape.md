This is the first project I made in Unity, I would like to present my Dreamscape design, which represents fading memories. I did this by meshing reality and nature together, creating a beauty in abandoned environments.

I've used assets from: 
- #NVJOB Simple Water Shaders by Nicholas Veselov
- Dream Forest Tree by IL.ranch
- Snaps Prototype | Asian Residential by Asset Store Originals
- Ambience - Banaue Rice Terraces by InspectorJ
-"Fisherman's Song at Dusk," Chinese Zither Performance by NTDonMusic
