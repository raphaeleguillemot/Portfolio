This artwork complements an article from ISSIA called "Genetic engineering -- benefits over ethics?" by Jing Yee. It's inspired by *Detroit: Become Human* and a specific scene the author describes at the end of their article, where genetically modified babies are sold to couples. I decided to also reference the traditional storks as the sellers.
