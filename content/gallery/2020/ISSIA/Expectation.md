For my last contribution to ISSIA, I wanted to tackle the social issue that interested me the most, and that was the education system. Over my time at VSA, I realise that the IB tried to gather a bunch of international kids to work but also compete with each other, while attempting to merge exams-based and liberal education. As a result, it undermined the amount of expectations placed upon the students. I recall myself conversing with a really smart student and we both suddenly realised that we're still high school students. We're not professional historians or scientists, but we're expected to be one in the IB system.

I'm not saying that I disliked my time in VSA, I did grow as a student and a person and it couldn't have been from any other way. But the self esteem of every student is extremely fragile at their last two years of high school. It could've been the program but it could've also been the environment, from school, home or even from Hong Kong itself.

That's why for this artwork, I wanted to raise how the expectations from our education system is so incredibly damaging to a student's self esteem. I wanted to show how suffocating it is to constantly have to live in expectation, like the girl drowning with her mental health as an anchor.

I was inspired by Gustav Klimt, specifically his piece "Expectation" (1905) which depicts a girl in a triangle-patterned dress. I loved how the pattern seemed so intimidating and appeared like arrows, thus I replicated such design in the background. I also used wave patterns under the triangles too to make the space feel more abstract.
