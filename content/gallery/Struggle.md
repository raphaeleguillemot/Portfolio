Struggle is an abstract piece that represents the struggle of controlling my responsibilities in real life. This is seen as how the frail, directionless/lost tree branches curl around to get back the cut log pieces, yet it's too big to handle. This was also inspired by Time Square as the cut log pieces are it’s floor tiles.
