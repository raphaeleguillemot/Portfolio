This work is inspired by Philip Larkin’s concept in Essential Beauty, where advertisements produce a perfect world based on the products, they encourage escapism. I interpret such perfect worlds on my identity and lifestyle and appear in pleasure as I blend into codes and rough, decaying textures, showing how my identity is decaying as it’s consumed by escapism.
