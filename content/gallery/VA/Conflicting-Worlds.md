Conflicting Worlds highlights the lost emotion in the detachment of reality. It vaguely depicts my room, which generates an intimate sensation of personal space, representing how reality is fabricated by ourselves as we attach meaning from visuals. It’s also trapped in a frame, emphasising the meaningless reality and a barrier between the work and the audience.
