The series is inspired by Shirin Neshat’s cultural inspiration application, where I look particularly into my culture and struggles with society: language barrier. This is seen from how Chinese words are covering my all of my face into the dark, where the Chinese words tell a story of my move to Hong Kong and how I felt socially isolated from everyone.
