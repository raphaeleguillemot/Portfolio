Green Forest is inspired by Muchaâ€™s art nouveau nature motif. It depicts how I feel isolated from society, which became a trigger to escape. This is seen from how I cower behind a leaf in a natural environment, which represents an ideal world as Hong Kong heavily lacks nature. Furthermore, on the right, the foreground consists of artificial green code, signifying a barrier from society in which only I can understand.
