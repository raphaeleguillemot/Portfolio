Rabbit Hole depicts escapism as falling into an inescapable hole. This can be seen as various poses, expressing pleasure, are layered further and further away from the audience, creating depth. Inspiration from Alice in Wonderland can be seen from texture, title and the quote at the back: “Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle!”.
