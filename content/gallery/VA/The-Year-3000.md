The final digital work depicts escapism’s role in the future, where the VR Headset streams a nature scene, with clouds creating my own “headspace”. The background is coherent to the exhibition via motifs and symbolises technology’s impact on our environment. The contrast between how realistic I look against the Pop Art styled background also links to the previous work on reality fabrication.
