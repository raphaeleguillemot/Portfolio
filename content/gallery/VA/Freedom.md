Inspired by visual qualities of the Clock Tower in Time Square and Dali’s The Persistence of Memory, Freedom depicts how escapism steals one’s future. This is seen from hands reaching towards a face-shaped cloud, who appears pensive, as if unable to help. The face-shaped cloud represents the ideal future self looking back and reacting to how plans of the future were unsuccessful, generating a sense of guilt.
